# Supp Wiki
*It's unclear what GitHub's rule are on what I can host here, so we'll keep this website ambiguous for now.*

The internet is polluted with bad advice around Supps. Every page is either trying to sell you something or scare you away.
Reddit seems to be the only viable alternative, but there's no incentive to be truthful there, either.
**This wiki exists to change that.**

If you're a Drexel student who knows anything about backend website development, join me! Let's build this wiki together!
